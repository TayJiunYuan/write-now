## üí° About

### Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a cost-effective digital PA system tailored for the administrators of the Singapore Book Council (SBC).

We understand that:

- SBC is a non-profit organization that organizes numerous events and programmes annually.
- As a small organization, SBC lacks the resources to hire a full-time personal assistants (PAs).

### Potential Issues

1. **Task Management Inefficiencies**  
   Administrators may struggle to manage the multitude of tasks associated with their programmes, leading to inefficiencies.

2. **Time Constraints and Burnout**  
   A heavy workload and tight schedules may cause stress and burnout among administrators.

3. **High Cost of Hiring a PA**  
   Hiring a full-time PA is expensive, which is not feasible for SBC as a non-profit organization.
